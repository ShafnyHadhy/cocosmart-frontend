Products they manufactured and distributed are virgin coconut oil(Rs.1500/500ml), Refined coconut oil(Rs.900), desiccated coconut(Rs.1700), coconut sugar(Rs.450/200ml), coconut water(Rs.150/200ml), copra(Rs.350/kg), coconut icecream(Rs.2000/500ml) and coconut chips(Rs.300/200g). The CocoSmart system is designed to streamline and digitalize coconut plantation management. It allows users to manage plantation plots by adding, editing, and deleting details while also tracking the number of trees in each plot. The system supports irrigation scheduling, harvesting date predictions, and integrates real-time weather updates to help farmers plan better. Additionally, it includes a chatbot to provide advice on farming, harvesting, and pest control to improve productivity.

There are about 155 workers are working in the company. There are 16 drivers to deliver the products. There are about 200 customers registered in the system. The company has around 6 plantation plots in different locations. The company has about 7 different products available for sale. The company has around 10 admin users managing the system.
Labor management is a key feature of CocoSmart. Plantation managers can assign daily tasks, schedule work in advance, track attendance, and monitor working hours of laborers. Workers can update their task progress, and the system generates payroll and performance reports to ensure fair and efficient workforce management.
The system also incorporates inventory management by allowing the entry of produced or purchased stock, setting reorder levels with alerts, and recording batch IDs with expiry dates to prevent losses. It supports QR code–based scanning for faster item tracking and automatically updates stock when production or sales transactions occur.
User management ensures secure access and role-based permissions. Admins can assign roles, monitor user activity logs, and manage profiles. Customers and plantation workers can register, log in, and maintain updated profiles within the system.
Transport management is another core module, enabling admins to assign deliveries to drivers, group deliveries by location for efficiency, and provide customers with live tracking of their orders. Transport costs are calculated automatically based on fuel and distance to reduce manual errors.
Customer engagement is supported through a feedback management module. Customers can submit, edit, or delete their feedback and ratings. Admins can moderate content by approving or rejecting submissions, and they can also reply directly to address concerns.
On the business side, sales management lets customers browse plantation products, place online orders, and track deliveries. Admins can manage product listings, view sales trends through dashboards, handle customer information, and create promotions or discounts to attract more buyers.
The finance management module provides comprehensive tracking of revenue, expenses, and overall financial health. Admins can generate invoices, manage payments, calculate profits and losses, and even forecast future financial performance based on past data. These features help maintain strong financial control and support strategic planning.
The system's development follows agile methodology with product backlogs, sprint planning, Kanban boards, and task allocations across three sprints. Each sprint gradually delivers key functionalities, starting with core modules like plot management, user access, inventory, and sales, and progressing to advanced features such as chatbots, weather integration, QR code scanning, financial forecasting, and worker performance reporting.
Coconut Planting Guide,
1. Climate Requirements
Temperature: 27-32 °C is ideal (cannot tolerate frost).
Rainfall: 1000-2500 mm annually, evenly distributed.
Sunlight: Needs full sun (shade reduces yield).
Altitude: Grows well up to 600 m above sea level.

2. Soil Requirements
Well-drained sandy loam, laterite, coastal alluvial soils are best.
Avoid waterlogged or rocky soils.
pH: 5.2 - 8.0 is suitable.
Good moisture-holding capacity is important in dry areas.

3. Season for Planting
Depends on rainfall pattern:
Southwest monsoon regions (like Sri Lanka's wet zone): Plant in May-June (onset of rains).
Dry zones / Irrigated areas: Plant in September-December with good soil moisture or irrigation.
General rule → beginning of rainy season so palms establish well.

4. Selection of Seedlings
Use 12-18 month old seedlings from a reliable nursery.
Choose seedlings with:
6-8 healthy leaves,
A stout girth at the collar,
Early splitting of leaves (a sign of vigor).

5. Planting Method

Spacing:
Normal spacing: 7.5 m × 7.5 m (about 175 palms/ha).
High-density planting: 6.5 m × 6.5 m (250 palms/ha).
On slopes: follow contour planting.

Pit Preparation:
Dig pits: 0.75 m × 0.75 m × 0.75 m (or larger in poor soil).
Expose soil to sun for a few weeks before planting.
Fill pit with mixture of topsoil + 10–15 kg farmyard manure/compost + sand if needed.

Planting:
Place the seedling in the center, roots spread out.

Depth: Collar level should be just above ground level.
Firm the soil around and water immediately.
Provide shade (banana leaves, coconut fronds) for young plants in hot/dry areas.

6. Aftercare & Management
Watering: Regular irrigation in dry season (especially first 2–3 years).
Mulching: Apply coconut husks, dried leaves, or coir pith around the base to conserve moisture.

Manuring/Fertilization:
Start from 1st year.
Typical dose per palm/year (from 4th year onwards):
500 g N, 320 g P₂O₅, 1200 g K₂O + 50 kg organic manure.
Weeding: Keep basin (1-1.5 m radius) free from weeds.
Intercropping: In young plantations, grow banana, pineapple, legumes, or vegetables for extra income.

7. Other Factors
Wind protection: Plant tall trees as windbreaks in cyclone-prone areas.
Drainage: In heavy rainfall areas, provide proper channels to prevent waterlogging.

Varieties:
Tall varieties (Sri Lanka Tall, West Coast Tall).
Dwarf varieties (Chowghat Orange Dwarf, Sri Lanka Green Dwarf).`
